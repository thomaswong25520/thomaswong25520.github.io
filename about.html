  <p>
    I am currently a
    <b
      >Technical Account Manager at
      <a href="https://reputation.com/">Reputation</a></b
    >. I have a strong foundation in cloud technologies (Python, SQL, AWS,
    Terraform) and a focus on building long-term, value-driven partnerships.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work closely with product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to ensure
    our clients — including multi-million ARR accounts — not only adopt our
    solutions effectively, but also unlock their full strategic potential. My
    approach is collaborative: I see clients not just as users, but as partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    I aim to understand their business goals, technical constraints, and future
    roadmap, so we can co-design solutions that are reliable, scalable, and
    aligned with long-term success. I’ve led post-launch programs, mitigated
    risks, and contributed to infrastructure and automation initiatives that
    improve both technical performance and customer experience. In parallel, I
    contribute to open-source projects focused on data architecture, cost
    efficiency, and resilient cloud infrastructure — with the goal of sharing
    practical tools that help teams scale more efficiently and sustainably.

    Whenever possible, I try to open source the code I write on my
    <a href="https://github.com/thomaswong25520">Github profile</a>.
