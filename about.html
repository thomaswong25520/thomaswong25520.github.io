    I'm a
    <b
      >Technical Account Manager at
      <a href="https://reputation.com/">Reputation</a></b
    >. I help enterprise clients succeed with our platform by combining
    technical skills with genuine partnership.

    What I care about:
    <ul>
      <li>
        - Customers first: I dig deep to understand what clients actually need,
        not just what they ask for
      </li>
      <li>
        - Clear communication: Making complex things simple is my thing
      </li>
      <li>
        - Building stuff that works: Real solutions, not band-aids
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    I'm currently diving into real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka, along
    with expanding my skills in Python, SQL, AWS, and Terraform. This blog
    tracks my journey through distributed systems and modern data
    infrastructure. I learn by doing and share what I build on GitHub. This
    space is my learning log â€“ expect experiments, failures, successes, and
    practical lessons as I go.
