Kafka isn’t just a technology for tech giants—it’s used by companies of all sizes to solve real business challenges. Here’s how leading organizations leverage Kafka:

- Financial Services
  Banks and fintech companies use Kafka to process millions of transactions in real time. For example, Goldman Sachs uses Kafka to log and analyze trading data, ensuring fast and accurate insights.

  Netflix relies on Kafka to track user activity and deliver personalized recommendations. Kafka’s ability to handle high-throughput streams makes it perfect for analyzing viewer behavior.

- Security and Monitoring
  Many enterprises use Kafka as part of their SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. Kafka streams security events from various sources, enabling real-time threat detection and response.

- E-commerce
  Online retailers use Kafka to process orders, track inventory, and analyze customer behavior—all in real time. This helps them optimize operations and improve customer experiences.

## Why It Matters

By centralizing and processing data streams in real time, Kafka helps companies make faster, data-driven decisions and stay competitive in a rapidly changing world.
