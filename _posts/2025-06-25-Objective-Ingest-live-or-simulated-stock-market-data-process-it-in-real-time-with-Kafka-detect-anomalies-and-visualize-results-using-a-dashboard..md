title: Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline on AWS

description: I was curious about how the stock market could be a real-world use case for Kafka, so I decided to build a real-time data pipeline myself. I set up Kafka to stream live or simulated stock prices, using Python to process the data. The project gave me hands-on experience with scalable, event-driven architecture.

## Objective:

Ingest live or simulated stock market data, process it in real-time with Kafka, detect anomalies, and visualize results using a dashboard.

### 1. Set Up Your Kafka Environment in the Cloud

I chose to deploy Kafka on AWS EC2 by leveraging their Free Tier usage using Terraform for infrastructure as code.

Then, I will start Zookeeper and Kafka broker and create a topic for stock data. I will name the topic `stock-market-data`

### 2. Generate or Source Stock Market Data

I will then use Alpha Vantage public API to generate free stock data

### 3. Build the Data Pipeline

- Producer: I will write a Python script to fetch or generate stock data and publish it to the Kafka topic.

- Consumer: I will write another Python script to consume data from the topic.

Optionally, use Kafka Streams (Java/Scala) or ksqlDB for advanced processing, but for Python, you can do stream processing with libraries like Faust or Apache Flinkâ€™s Python API (if you want to go beyond basic consumption).

### 4. Store and Visualize Results

- Storage: Use AWS S3 to store raw and processed data (can be automated with Kafka Connect or custom scripts).

- Visualization: Build a dashboard using AWS QuickSight and display live stock prices.

### 5. Automate and Monitor

- Automation: Use Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure.

- Set up CI/CD pipelines for your scripts using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.

- Monitoring: Monitor Kafka topics and pipeline health using Prometheus and Grafana or AWS CloudWatch.
